# Executive Summary 

# Data Summary / EDA
* Nature of the data, origin
* Necessary quantitative and graphical summaries
* Are there any problems with the data?
* Which variables are considered as input 

```{r}
diab <- read.csv("diabetic.data.csv")
head(diab)
summary(diab)
names(diab)
```
```{r}
readmission <- read.csv("readmission.csv")
head(readmission)
summary(readmission)
names(readmission)
```

The original data is from the [Center for Clinical and Translational Research](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) at Virginia Commonwealth University. It covers data on diabetes patients across 130 U.S. hospitals from 1999 to 2008. There are over 100,000 unique hospital admissions in this dataset, from ~70,000 unique patients. The data includes demographic elements, such as age, gender, and race, as well as clinical attributes such as tests conducted, emergency/inpatient visits, etc.

# Analysis 
* Various appropriate statistical methods: e.g. glmnet 
* Comparisons various models
* Final model(s)

# Conclusion
* Summarize results and the final model
* Final recommendations

# Appendix
* Any thing necessary to keep but for which you donâ€™t want them to be in the main report
* Use Appendices to display lengthy output.
